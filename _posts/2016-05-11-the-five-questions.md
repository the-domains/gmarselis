All stories have a beginning. I suppose. 

Even the Neverending Ones. 

Most stories start with the Who and describe the Where. Some circumnavigate the Why and paw on the What, to maintain suspense. 

The peculiar Ones... Those are tricky. They use the Roaring Storm Waves of Narration, throwing the reader around, pulling him up on the back of monstrous waves, to deliver him crashing down to the bowel of the trough, the seconds edging by, leaving him to the slow, hopeless realisation of the next giant towering above him. Leaving him with the feeling of the moment the eyes splayed wide open at the imminent realization of his ensuing looming Death...

Those Stories, open with the How.
