I run to find shelter under the hundred-year old willow tree in our yard, trying to find some cover from this wretched weather. This was the only healthy tree for miles, after that mucus had taken over the near countryside.

I could not really make sense of the whole story. What could possibly had Tim meant? and that particular stretch of that pun; What on earth... "What could I possibly be?", I thought to myself. There should be more avenues I could seek refuge.

Lighting and the closely-following thunder, brought me back to reality with a startle. I was forced to take inventory of my surroundings: The house was laying tall on the north by north-east. The help's side door was half-open, the upper leaf laying lazingly ajar. Mr. Eric always enjoys listening to the dribbling sound of the rain.

To the north, the stables lay empty after we sold the last of the horses, five years ago. It was their time to go, they deserved better care.
